Voice Assistant Using Python
This project is a virtual voice assistant built using Python. It can understand user commands via speech recognition, perform various tasks such as web searches, fetching Wikipedia summaries, sending emails, and controlling system operations. The assistant responds using text-to-speech technology, making user interaction seamless.

Features
Speech Recognition: Captures user commands using voice input.
Text-to-Speech: Provides voice responses to user queries.
Task Automation:
Fetch current time and date.
Search the web or Wikipedia.
Play music and tell jokes.
Control system tasks like locking the screen or shutting down.
Email Automation: Sends emails through voice commands.
Weather Updates: Provides weather information using a web API.
Requirements
Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install speechrecognition pyttsx3 wikipedia webbrowser smtplib wolframalpha requests pyaudio pyjokes
Other dependencies like subprocess, ctypes, and os are built-in Python libraries.

Setup and Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/voice-assistant-python.git
cd voice-assistant-python
Install required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the assistant:

bash
Copy code
python voice_assistant.py
How It Works
The assistant listens to your voice commands using speech_recognition.
Based on the command, it executes actions such as web searches, Wikipedia queries, sending emails, or system commands.
It responds through pyttsx3 by reading out results or confirmations.
Customization
You can change the name of the assistant by modifying the assname variable in the script.
Set your email credentials in the sendEmail() function to use the email functionality.
Future Enhancements
Integrating sentiment analysis for understanding mood.
Adding more advanced features like smart home device control.
